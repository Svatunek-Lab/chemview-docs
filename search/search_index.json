To load a molecule/file Drag a file into the browser. Open using the file menu. Load a structure by using a name or SMILES with the \"LUPESYMBOL Molecule\" button or by hitting \"n\" over the molecule view area. Load remote files using /?file=filename.extension at the end of the link. Navigate through file Navigation can be done using the tree on the right. Arrow keys also navigate through it.
