## To load a molecule/file

- Drag a file into the browser.
- Open using the file menu.
- Load a structure by using a name or SMILES with the "LUPESYMBOL Molecule" button or by hitting "n" over the molecule view area.
- Load remote files using `/?file=filename.extension` at the end of the link.

## Navigate through file

- Navigation can be done using the tree on the right.
- Arrow keys also navigate through it.

## Look at data
